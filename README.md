# Genomics of the outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus in Madagascar 2021

This repository analyzes genomes of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) circulating in madagascar 2021 (n=17) using Nextstrain. The build was constructed using a total of 147 RVFV full-length genomes (all 3 segments). 

This work is ongoing, and is performed in collaboration with Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (http://www.pasteur.mg/ contact: Dr Philippe Dussart). 

Please do not hesitate to contact us (https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/evolutionary-genomics-rna-viruses/) if this could be relevant to your work!

The phylogeny can be visualized at https://nextstrain.org/community/Simon-LoriereLab/rift_L@main

This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data by research groups from all over the world. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions.
